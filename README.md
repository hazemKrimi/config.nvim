# My NVIM Config

This repo contains my custom NeoVim config for software development.

# Requirements

1. Install [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html) if you do not have it already.

2. Install NeoVim following the [Installation docs](https://neovim.io/doc/install/):

3. Optionally install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

## References

My config is based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) but I customized it following [Henry Misc's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYDG3AHgYEs&t=1229s).
